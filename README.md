Abstract

Technologies used:

   HTML, CSS*, Ajax, jQuery, PHP, Datatables.net, Google Api: Maps
         

A user can navigate throught the table and find other people around the world that an entry have been made for them. There are links to their respective websites and map locations. 
The website is responsive to the point that it will never need to reload after any action made on it.

The data are kept in a csv file. This csv file is converted into a JSON file, as JSON data are valid for a datatables.net table to work correctly. This procedure is taking place every time the table data are needed.
Through the form, data are added into the csv file, and the table auto-refreshes. User has the option to download the data as csv or json.


   *Original CSS styles made from others but modified. See the relevant file inside "owl template" folder for more info.
